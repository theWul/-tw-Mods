EPOE-extension to allow finger and toe replacements.
Ensure that EPOE is loaded prior to this mod.
 
Based heavily on the mod "Prosthetic Didgets" by Zero.
I used the same ThingDef-names so you can upgrade existing saves to the EPOE-version without losing any already installed parts.
And of course credits to Ykara for the fantastic EPOE mod.
