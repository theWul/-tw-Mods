Of course there are quite some other mods offering a broad range of terraforming.
And of course is the approach of this mod inspired by those mods, but there are a couple of differences "by design" to be mentioned:
     * stay as close to vanilla as possible
     * focus on agriculture, no more, no less
     * add a gameplay element that works through every phase of the game
The last point is the one responsible for having the somewhat artifical "make fertilizer out of compost" mechanic - implemented to give compost usage throughout the game.     

new research: Composting

raw compost:
     Organic stuff giving the "... has rotted away in storage" message now converts into "raw compost".
     Can be crafted at the crafting spot from any nutrients.
     Has to be disposed somewhere or can be used in a composter.
compost:
     obviously "composting" research required
     produced in one of the available composters
     compost bin: 
          easy to build from wood, but its efficiency depends on temperature
     industrial composter:
          as long as power is available temperature independent
          "electricity" required   
fertilizer:
     "drug production" required
     produced at the drug labor
     2 compost -> 1 fertilizer

Finally the terrains placeable:          
tilled soil: 
     fertility: 1.2
     requires 150 work to build    
enriched soil: 
     fertility: 1.4 (equal to rich soil)
     requires 1 compost and 300 work to build
fertilized soil:
     fertility: 2.0
     requires 1 fertilizer and 150 work to build

Two higher contrast textures for mud and gravel have been added.

Whats planned:
     * a mechanic where the placed soil will be removed after harvesting, leaving a blueprint. This would require quite some rebalancing, but should add to the immersion of actuall doing "agriculture"...
     No promises though =)
